The US DOE Exascale Computing Project (ECP) is preparing to deliver science and engineering computing capabilities for machines that can perform up to a billion-billion operations per second.  Realizing this performance potential requires fundamental changes in algorithms, software design and development.  In addition, ECP is integrating software activities across all major DOE labs and numerous universities and corporations at a larger scale than ever before.

In this presentation we characterize the challenges that ECP software efforts face and describe the strategies and status of efforts.  We first provide an overview of the architectural challenges and software requirements.  We then talk about software efforts to meet these challenges.  Finally, we discuss how we are organizing and executing this large project-of-projects, highlighting strategies for effective communication and delivery of software capabilities.
