The path to scalable performance on next generation platforms must include design and implementation for accelerated computations, including addressing all phases of computation and data movement.

In this presentation, we will provide an overview of the current challenges and approaches being used by several teams of sparse linear algebra algorithm and software developers. We will discuss design requirements, implementation strategies and use of new approaches for reducing data bandwidth requirements.
