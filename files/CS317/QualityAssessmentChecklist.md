### Assessing Quality Using a Checklist

Checklists are useful for many things: packing for a trip, household chores and launching a rocket into space.  A useful checklist for a software project is one that lists practices, processes and tools used to develop a product.  This checklist can be used both internally and externally to assure and assess quality.

A quality checklist should certainly contain items that a team is addressing at the present time, but it should also include items that a team wants to address in the future.

Use this checklist as a starting point for your own assessment.  We will use it for major product presentations.  For each item you check, you should be able to point to evidence to support your assertion.
