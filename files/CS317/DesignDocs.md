### Design Documentation

Agile software methodologies emphasize _Working software over comprehensive documentation_ ([Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org)).  Even so, lightweight design documents are an important development tool and provide a very valuable means of conveying the intent and basic structure of a software product before it is written.

Design documents are valuable for a variety of reasons:
1. **Improve product team thinking:** Writing thoughts tends to improve our understanding, independent of being able to communicate to others.
1. **Improve common understanding across the product team:** Verbal exchange can obscure detail and give a false impression that everyone on the team understands and agrees about the product.  Writing can address this challenge.
1. **Enables rapid dissemination of design and more opportunity for feedback:** A right-sized design document can enable the team to get buy-in from stakeholders and input from experts whose feedback would improve the design.
