### Discussion Guidelines
- Read the material before coming to class.  You won't be quizzed on it, but do it because it is the right thing to do.
- Discussions will first occur in small groups.  
  - As discussion occurs, respect and try to understand all comments made.

- Summary discussion will occur with the whole class.
  - Designated speaker for each small group will synthesis group points.
  - Other team members can bring up or clarify group ideas.
